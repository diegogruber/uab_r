## Objectives

This **is not** intended as a course on statistical methods or econometric techniques! 

Instead, you will learn how to 

- Explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data 
- Make your code reproducible, reusable, and shareable 
- Improve the efficiency and enjoyability of your workflow

## Outline

1. An overview of the R ecosystem
2. Data visualization
3. Data wrangling
4. Data Analysis

The R Ecosystem
===============

## R

- A programming language and software environment
- Created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
    - 1993: Research project in Auckland, NZ  
    - 1995: R Released as **open-source software**
    - 1997: R core group formed...
    - 2000: R 1.0.0 released
- Designed for statistical analysis and graphics
    - As opposed to general purpose language, such as Python
- Published under GNU license -> **Open source!**
 
## R - Extensibility

- Capabilities of R are extended through **user-created packages**
- Packages are mainly hosted on **[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)**
    - quality and licensing requirements
    - core group volunteers and automated testing
- Other popular repositories:
    - Bioconductor (for bioinformatics)
    - Github (mostly for development)

## RStudio

- Free and open source [IDE for R](www.rstudio.com)
- Desktop and Server
- **Panes** 
    - Code Editor, Console, Debugger, Plots, Viewer, Packages...
- **Cheatsheets!**
- **Options**
    - Tip: turn off automatic save / load of your last session.
- **Projects**
    - Great way to organize your work
- **Packages**
    - Become an R developer

## RMarkdown

- **Markdown** is a text-to-HTML conversion tool developed by John Gruber (no relation!)
- It allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert to HTML
- Quick reference in RStudio
- [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) allows you to intersperse Markdown with *R-chunks*
- Also supported: **LaTeX!**
- Other output formats: PDF, Word, Github, RTF, ODT, custom formats
- **Reproducible Research:** full computational environment required to reproduce the results in a research paper (data, code, etc.)

## Version Control

## Version Control

- **Keep track of changes** in your project
- **Backup** your files and restore previous versions
- Maintain **multiple versions**, eventually merge them
- **Collaborate** with people
- **Share** your work with the world

## Git

- Git is a decentralized version control system
- Created by Linus Torvalds
- Current standard in software development
- Command line or GUI
    - RStudio
    - Sourcetree
- Remote repository services
    - Github
    - Bitbucket
