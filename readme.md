Description
-----------

This course provides a brief 10-hour introduction to the R programming language and the RStudio IDE. This is not intended as a course on statistical methods or econometric techniques! Instead, you will learn how to explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data while making your code reproducible, reusable, and shareable. It's about making your workflow more efficient and enjoyable.

The aim of the course is to prepare you to keep exploring R on your own by pointing you to the best resources available.

Software
--------

Before the first class you should have the following software running on your system:

+ The latest version of [R](https://www.r-project.org)
+ The latest desktop version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/)
+ RStudio has an integrated Git client, but it's very basic. I recommend using [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com).

Also, you should sign up for a Github account.

Topics
------

+ **About R and RStudio.** Meet your new friends.
    - **The R console.** Where R talks back to you.
    - **Help!** Where and how to get it.
    - Installing and loading **packages**. Behold the power of the R community! Tailor R to your needs.
    - **R scripts and comments.** Writing code that is reusable.
    - **RStudio projects.** Keeping your work organized.
+ **R Markdown.** Easily write reports, papers, and presentations combining R with the Markdown language. Then convert to HTML, PDF or Word. This is how you will take notes and submit your work for this class.
+ **Git crash course.** Back up your code, keep track of changes, maintain different versions, and collaborate with others.
+ **Data visualization with _ggplot2_**. An introduction to the grammar of graphics.
+ **Exploring data.** Getting a quick glance.
+ **_magrittr_ pipes** Chaining operations to make your code easier to read.
+ **Data 'janitoring'.** Subsetting, merging, transforming data and more (this is what you'll be doing 80% of the time).
+ **Importing data.** Working with your own problems.
+ **R types and classes.** You'll have to learn about this eventually.
+ **Control structures**. Ifs, fors, whiles and the `apply` functions. Start programming in R.
+ Writing and debugging **your own functions**. Forget about copy-pasting your own code.
+ Basic **statistics.** 
+ **Group-by operations.** Split, apply, combine.
+ Linear **regression** and generalized linear models.
+ Dealing with **time series** data and models.
+ **Speeding up** your code.
+ Further **references** to learn more and keep up with the developments in the R community.
